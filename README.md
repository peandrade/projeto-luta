# ðŸŽ‰ First Project: HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my very first project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! ðŸš€  
This project marks the beginning of my journey as a developer â€” simple now, but full of potential!

## ðŸ“„ About

This project is a foundational step where I practiced:
- Basic HTML structure
- Styling with CSS

It's just the first step, but every big journey starts with small, consistent efforts!

This is the first of many projects to come. The more I learn, the more advanced, creative, and polished the upcoming projects will be. **Stay tuned for new features, improvements, and completely new ideas coming soon!** âœ¨

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
